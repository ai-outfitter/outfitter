# Outfitter File Structure

This document records the key repository file and directory structure used by Outfitter.
See [`./README.md`](./README.md) for runtime file conventions such as `.agents` layers, settings files, and generated composition directories.

> **RFC [#165](https://github.com/ai-outfitter/outfitter/issues/165) status:** the profile-era `profiles/` and `compositeProfile/` modules have been removed; `code/cli/src` now uses the dotagents pipeline (`resolver/`, `composer/`, `projection/`, `dump/`, `sources/`). Interactive `.agents` onboarding is back as `setup/` (the `outfitter setup` command and the implicit first-run trigger from `run`); remote `sync` remains deferred to a follow-up PR.

## Repository Layout

Outfitter is organized around a private npm workspace root, clear TypeScript package boundaries, requirement documents, and scenario-based tests.

```

The exact layout may evolve, but these boundaries should stay recognizable. Root scripts delegate to the `@ai-outfitter/outfitter` workspace so commands such as `npm run check-ci` continue to work from the repository root.

## Published Package Assets

The CLI package root is `code/cli`, but the npm package must still include repository-level notices. The CLI package `prepack` script runs `code/cli/scripts/sync-package-assets.mjs`, which stages `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `code/enterprise/LICENSE`, and `code/enterprise/README.md` inside `code/cli` before `npm pack` or `npm publish`.

## Test Fixtures

Integration fixtures should live under `code/cli/tests/fixtures/integration/` with full `home/`, `project/`, and optional `expected/` trees.
Fixture-backed integration tests and shared harness helpers should live under `code/cli/tests/integration/`.

Scenario fixtures should live under `code/cli/tests/fixtures/scenarios/`, for example:

```text
code/cli/tests/fixtures/scenarios/
  profile-cycle/
  profile-inheritance-chain/
  profile-missing-inheritance/
  profile-multiple-inheritance/
  profile-precedence/
```

The `profile-*` scenarios above are the current profile-era fixtures; per the transition note, the implementation PRs that add the resolver and composition modules replace them with target-state scenarios whose fixtures include realistic `.agents` trees and expected resolution output. Protocol conformance fixtures (layered trees plus expected effective output, pinned to the protocol revision) follow the same convention.
